# luftballons99 (iOS game)

This Swift application demonstrates a minimal hybrid iOS App. 

Code is based on: 
- Swift 4, 
- HTML (incl. SVG) and 
- JavaScript.

It should answer the questions: 
- How to setup WKWebView for interaction between native iOS code and JavaScript?
- How to call JavaScript from Swift 4 code?
- How to call Swift 4 code with parameters from JavaScript as JSON?
- How to dynamically insert code into the HTML?
- How to use basic internationalisation of strings for the user interface?

You may find it here https://itunes.apple.com/developer/markus-sprunck/id1141912893?mt=8 in the AppStore.

In the main.html and main.js you will read mainly German comments, because this code was written together with my son Korbinian when he was a fifth-grader. The game is based on his ideas.
